Flask-DI - type hinting based dependency injection for Flask and Python >=3.5
==================================================================

Introduction
------------
Dependency injection is a technique that seems rather unpopular in Python, probably
because Python offers some other ways to deal with the related problems. I still
consider traditional dependency injection good software craftsmanship and was
looking for a quick and simple way to inject dependencies into my Flask applications using Pythons
newest type hinting features.

How to get Flask-DI?
--------------------
Currently, Flask-DI is only available on Github. I will submit this package to
PyPI as soon as I feel satisfied with the feature set.

Examples?
----------------------------
I included some examples in the `examples` package to get you started.
